# predictive-cloud-cost-optimizer# Predictive Cloud Cost Optimizer

## Description
This project is a smart cloud cost optimization tool that leverages machine learning to analyze cloud usage patterns, predict cost spikes, and recommend or automate resource optimizations. It integrates with Terraform for infrastructure management and supports AWS/GCP APIs for real-time usage data.

## Features
- Collects and analyzes cloud usage and billing data
- Predicts future cost spikes using ML time-series forecasting
- Provides actionable optimization recommendations (e.g., rightsizing, scheduling, reserved instances)
- Integrates with Terraform for automated resource adjustments
- Sends alerts via Slack/Email for detected anomalies

## Tech Stack
- Python (ML: scikit-learn, Prophet, or TensorFlow)
- Terraform (for infrastructure as code)
- AWS/GCP APIs (for cloud usage data)
- Prometheus/Grafana (for monitoring and dashboards)
- Slack/Email API (for notifications)

## Branches
- `main`: Stable, production-ready code
- `dev`: Active development and feature integration
- `ml-forecasting`: Experimental ML models and forecasting improvements
- `terraform-integration`: Infrastructure automation enhancements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Terraform
- AWS/GCP account credentials
- Slack webhook (optional)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/predictive-cloud-cost-optimizer.git
    cd predictive-cloud-cost-optimizer
    ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Configure cloud credentials**
    - Set up your AWS/GCP credentials as environment variables or in the `config/` folder.

4. **Run initial data collection**
    ```
    python scripts/collect_usage_data.py
    ```

5. **Train and run the ML model**
    ```
    python scripts/predict_costs.py
    ```

6. **Apply optimization recommendations with Terraform**
    ```
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

7. **(Optional) Set up alerting**
    - Configure your Slack webhook or email settings in `config/alerts.yaml`.
